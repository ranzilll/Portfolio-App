## Next Steps

- [ ] Install markdown preview to see how you can view this document
- [ ] Learn basics of markdown
- [ ] Clear all boiler plate code from Vite so get rid of the counter
- [ ] Similarly in `style.css` file get rid of everything you don't need
- [ ] Using CSS variables define your root colors
- [ ] Reference these colors using CSS variable syntax
- [ ] Have toggle switch ready on click of an icon
- [ ] Have header ready as per design
- [ ] [Design Source](https://quizzical-tereshkova-4ea12e.netlify.app/)
- [ ] If stuck, google problem / use chatGPT, `how to define variables in CSS root`


## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] First fold is ready with a toggle switch and header
- [ ] I have commited my code regularly
- [ ] I have asked questions when I felt stuck and not tried to mug stuff
- [ ] I understand basics of markdown

## Task Update 
- [ ] Header with the toggle switch is **ready** (still need to add toggle functionality for dark mode and light mode)
- [ ] I also understood the Basics of markdown preview

## Update 15/12 + Next Steps
- [ ] We still have a counter.js file that serves no purpose so should be deleted.
- [ ] Get the toggle switch to work
- [ ] There is the main.js file but it's importing the CSS file? (Get rid of the import since you're importing the file in the HTML)
- [ ] There is a javascript.svg file in the src folder, which feels like a stray file? Even if it is needed it should be in a seperate folder called assets ( learn to organize code into relevant folders so assets and images should be in a seperate folder called assets) This also expands to having full control of what files are inside the repository, each file should serve a purpose or not be there.
- [ ] Why do we have a class called `container-1` can we not just apply the styles to the header directly?
- [ ] containers are supposed to be universal, you cannot have container-1, container-2, container-n
- [ ] Line 15 in index.html needs to be changed see github comment
- [ ] Have left comments on github where code needs improvement.
- [ ] Get the toggle switch working
- [ ] Design is not mobile responsive so we should have a hamburger menu when the screen size drops below 768px
- [ ] Font is not loading/ hasn't been applied, Please use the google font Inter and the different weights so the Header should be a medium weight and body copy should use the light weight, learn font weights and how to import google fonts into the project
- [ ] First fold should include introduction body copy carefully thought out, use the internet use ChatGPT but don't blindly copy. Add your own flair
- [ ] Start working on the skills and tools section. Section should all the images and bits aligned like the design
- [ ] Update favicon of the site.
- [ ] Implement the library https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/ into the project.
